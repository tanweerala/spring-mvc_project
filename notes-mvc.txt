Spring MVC
==========
It is a module of spring framework
It is also a framework
MVC stands for model view and controller
MVC is a design pattern
MVC desgin pattern separates presentation layer of the application from the business and data layer of the application.In case both frontend developer and backend can work independently

Spring MVC framework uses this desgign pattern
Spring MVC framework is used to build web application
Main advantage of this framework is separation of prsentation layer from business and data layer
If presentation layer will be changed then business and data layer will not be affected
If business layer will be changed then presentation layer will not be affected

What is model?
--------------
In Spring MVC application, model is an object and it encapsulates/holds data that will be shown to the user by view/presentation layer/page
Model is created by front controller
Data into model is kept by controller
Data from the model is extracted by view

What is View?
-------------
It is page/template
It accepts input from user and shows output/response to the user
We can create view by using:
a)HTML
b)CSS
c)JS
d)JSP or thymeleaf
View extracts output data from model objects

What is controller?
-------------------
It is class defined by back-end developer
It means you will have to define this class
In this class you will have to define methods
These methods are known as request handler
These methods are mapped with request url(http://localhost:8080/product-management-viewresolver/search-product)
We will have to map these methods with request url
These methods will be called by front controller
(Front controller is a predefined controller)

Role play by controller
-----------------------
1)Accepting input sent by user
2)Calling back-end services(If code is written)
3)Accepting value returned by back-end services(If code is written)
4)Storing value/data/response into model object
...............................
At the end controller will return view name to the front controller
An application can have multiple controllers
